# Push to GitHub After Every Update

After making any code changes in this project, **always** push the updates to GitHub.

## Steps

1. **Stage changes**: `git add` (e.g. `git add .` or specific files).
2. **Commit** with a short, descriptive message:  
   `git commit -m "Brief description of what changed"`.
3. **Push** to the default branch:  
   `git push origin main` (or the project’s main branch name).

## Notes

- Use `;` instead of `&&` when chaining commands in PowerShell (e.g. `git add .; git commit -m "message"; git push origin main`).
- Do this at the end of the session when you’ve finished the requested changes, unless the user asks not to push.
- If the user has not configured a remote or branch, only add and commit locally and tell them to set up the remote/push manually if needed.
